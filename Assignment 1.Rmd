## Document assignment

Consider the following situation:  

A sloppy printer produces books with an average of 2 misprints per page. You want to
know how many pages have more than k misprints in a book of n pages. Make an n x k table that shows the relationship between the total number of pages in a book and the number of pages with k misprints.

Show and explain your work.  Include equations and calculations to teach the reader how to solve the problem.  Include an image of a book.

Push your solution to a github repository and submit the url for repository on blackboard.

Be sure your repo includes your document as a pdf file and as an RMD file.  Include other files needed to recompile your document.

Instruction for this assignment:
1.From the first two sentences of these questions, we can know that each page with more than k misprints is under a poison distribution that $Poisson(\lambda = 2)$ 
2.Then the probability p_k of more than k misprints on a page is $p_k = P(M > k) = 1 - P(M \leq k) =$ 1 - ppois($k$, lambda = 2).  
3.Then we have 50 pages in binomial distribution with p_k, calculated above. 
4.Finally, we output the n by k table with probability of T no more than n pages with more than k misprints:$P(T \leq n) =$ pbinom($n$, 50, $p_k$).
